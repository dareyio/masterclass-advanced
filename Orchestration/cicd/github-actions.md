Course Outline:

### Module 1: Introduction to GitHub Actions

- Understanding the basics of GitHub Actions:
    GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool that allows you to automate your software development workflows directly from your GitHub repository. With Actions, you can build, test, and deploy your code seamlessly. Actions are defined in YAML files called workflow files that reside in the .github/workflows directory of your repository.

- Exploring the benefits and use cases: 
    
    - Continuous Integration (CI): Automate build and test processes to ensure code quality and detect issues early.

    - Continuous Deployment (CD): Automate the deployment of your applications to various hosting platforms or cloud services.
  
    - Automated Testing: Set up automated tests to validate your code changes and prevent regressions.
    
    - Release Management: Create release workflows to generate artifacts, publish releases, and notify team members.
    
    - Custom Workflows: Define custom workflows to fit your specific project requirements.


- Setting up and configuring GitHub Actions in your repository
   .github/workflows/main.yaml
            ```
            name: Build and Test
            on: [push]

            jobs:
            build:
                runs-on: ubuntu-latest

                steps:
                - name: Checkout code
                uses: actions/checkout@v2

                - name: Build
                run: npm install

                - name: Test
                run: npm test
                ```
